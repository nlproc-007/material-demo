# What is Softmax Activation Function?
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The softmax activation function is a commonly used activation function in machine learning, particularly in the context of multi-class classification problems. It is used to transform a vector of real numbers into a probability distribution over multiple classes. The output of the softmax function assigns probabilities to each class, indicating the likelihood of an input belonging to each class. </p>
